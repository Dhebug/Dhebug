# About me
I'm professionally a video game developer, you can see the complete list of games I worked on on my [MobyGames profile page](https://www.mobygames.com/person/45003/mickael-pointier/) and my work experience on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mickaelpointier/).

As a hobbyish, I'm a retro enthusiast tinkering with old MIDI equipment, Minitels, Oric and Atari computers, I'm the webmaster of [Defence Force](https://defence-force.org), I maintain the [Oric Software Development Kit](https://osdk.org) as well as the [Oric Library](https://library.defence-force.org), and I like to share what I'm doing on [my blog](https://blog.defence-force.org) or my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWZt9Nt6Qo5ZmHFJtZzvgEw).

I do not have a Patreon, there are no ads anywhere, no hidden analytics or tracking cookies either.

# Regarding the code
Here you will find an eclectic collection of software I've been working on as a hobby: Some tools, demos and games, written in [6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) or [68000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000) Assembler, BASIC, C or C++.

Most of these had already been published earlier, either as stand alone archives or files, or in my old SVN repository, unfortunately SVN support in ~2023~2024 sucks, so I had to migrate to Git... so there you are... which also means that most of the dates for commits are wrong, which implies that my commit history on GitHub is not to be trusted.

I did not bother adding licenses on most of these, but the bottom line is: 
- Be nice
- Feel free to use anything in non profit products as long as you credit properly
